MY Final Year Project 


Brief Introduction

National Farmer Corporation provides the facilities to farmer to know about the exact prices of  
desirable stuff like wheat, rice, sugarcane, cotton, etc. Farmer can buy and sell their stuff 
through this system. The former will upload his stuff on his profile along with detail. Managers
and Brokers will make bid on farmer stuff according their desired prices. Broker/Managers can 
chat with Farmer through chatting module of this website.

Farmer can also buy seeds, sprays, fertilizers, urea, Farmer can also apply for subsidy provided by  
Government of Pakistan and Private Industries.
This website also provides the features of writing and posting a post or any event at one place. The main idea behind it is to share the Farmer problems related details posted by farmer via adding a post which can be read by all that using the website. This web application can be handled by the admin and manager of different industries.
